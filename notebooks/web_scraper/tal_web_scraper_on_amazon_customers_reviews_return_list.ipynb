Buying them again after such a long gap I was delighted to discover the Bacon Fries were just as good as I remembered (though the Scampi Fries just as dire), so when Amazon listed them in dedicated cases in its Grocery Store I banged off an order straight away - even though the price per bag quoted was more expensive than the supermarket. No more forced purchasing of Scampi Fries - happy days!Sadly that was back in August and as the original estimated delivery date came and went I was disappointed to see that the 'usually dispatched within...' date had increased from a number of weeks to 'between one and two months'.So as I sit here, gazing through the window at the torrential rain of autumn, I look back with fondness to that balmy sunny day in summer when I placed the order for this product with such optimism.Five stars for the product (which I'm still buying - with the unwanted Scampi Fries - from my local supermarket) but no stars for the Amazon ordering process. Anyone who wants this product should order it now if they want it in time for Christmas, though even that might be optimistic...*** UPDATE ***Well the waiting is over and I'm tempted to pull all the little bags off the backing card and throw them in the air with joy, but that would be silly.

       " 'Being what I consider, an expert on baked and fried savoury snacks, I felt it was my duty to review these bacon flavour fries.First off, I placed the order for them on a sunday afternoon, and they were delivered late monday, which I have to say is an excellent service, so two thumbs up to Amazon for that.Getting down to the nitty gritty, and why you\\'re here, the snacks themselves.I first tried these snacks many years ago, back when I was a young man, and still went to the pub on weekends with friends. Being the ancient person I am now, and also having no friends, I no longer go to the pub and therefore, haven\\'t had the opportunity to have these for many many years.One day, whilst perusing Amazon, these bacon fries popped into my head, and I wondered...just...wondered...if I could buy them on here and re-live my old days of care-free drinking, laughter and bacon snacking.Imagine my joy when I discovered I could buy not just one bag, but an entire cardboard thing covered in 24 bags! I bought them immediately.Upon receiving them, I immediately placed the cardboard dispenser on a nail in my wall in the kicthen - the nail was already there when I moved into the house. I can only imagine it once allowed a photo or perhaps a painting to hang proudly, displaying either a delightful joyous family scene, or perhaps a very distasteful picture of dogs playing poker. Who knows. Not I.Anyway, they were now in a prime position for me to fill up a glass of flavoured water ( I do not drink anymore, gave that up years ago due to going from sober, straight to vomitting - there was never a good inbetween part for me)and then grab one of the bags from its cardboard captor and then head off to my front room to sit there in silence on my own.When opening the bag, the bacony aroma coming from the bag immediately whisked me back to the early 1990\\'s. I was 21 again, standing in the pub chatting with \"the lads\" pretending to know what they were going on about whilst discussing football, laughing at the crude jokes and constantly looking at my watch wondering why its been 10pm for what feels like 4 hours and how I wish I could just go home. \"I\\'m off to get some crisps\" I\\'d say, \"anyone want something\" ?\"I\\'ll have a pint\"\"Me too\"\"and me\"great. I was offering a bag of crisps, not an entire pint of beer, and I assume that means we\\'re not leaving anytime soon!But anyway, I\\'d get myself some bacon flavour fries and not offer one to anybody. I offered them snacks and they wanted beer, so tough, you\\'re not getting one of my crisps.And I recall I would thoroughly enjoy my bacon fries, and then wish I had bought two bags rather than one.Once I had finished them, drunk the rest of my pint, and the guys I was with had got through the 3 more pints they\\'d bought in that time, it would be time to go home. The best part of the night for me! Until those immortal words would be uttered: \"shall we go to a club?\".It would be at this point I\\'d wish the ground would just open up and swallow me. \"No, I\\'m not into that, you guys go, I\\'m going to get off home I think.\"No you have to come, there\\'ll be loads of birds there\".Yes - the word \"birds\" was used. Hey come on, we were young and it was the early 90\\'s. We weren\\'t as enlightened then as we are now.I would protest, tell them I\\'m not keen, and that they should go and I\\'ll just get a cab home. I wouldn\\'t. I couldn\\'t afford to do that on my own, I\\'d end up walking miles home on my own. It\\'s a wonder I didn\\'t get mugged one of those nights.Honestly, I never liked going to these clubs. I\\'d get in there, stand in the corner with my 4 pound bottle of Sol with a small wedge of lime in the top and look at everyone dancing, people meeting possible new lovers, and all the while I\\'m thinking \"I wish I had the courage to talk to that lady over there\". I never did though, hence my desire to get home rather than put myself through that torture.I\\'m getting a little side-tracked here. We\\'re talking bacon fries aren\\'t we.So I\\'d opened the bag, the bacony whiff took me back to my youth and when eating one for the first time in such a long time, I remembered instantly why I like them so much. Such a strong delicious flavour, and the texture of them - so crunchy, just perfect!!I devoured the whole bag in seconds - one drawback of these, the bags are very small indeed. The same sort of size as the Mr Porky Pork Scratchings bags, which are tiny little things. But these are better than pork scratchings because you don\\'t need to be drunk to enjoy them.So, I whole-heartedly recommend these to anyone at all. And I say anyone - even vegatarians! The bag states \"suitable for vegetarians\" so I\\'m assuming that delicious bacon flavour was synthesised in a lab somewhere and contains no meat products whatsoever. Not sure why it doesn\\'t say they\\'re suitable for vegans too, but I\\'m not a very clever person and don\\'t know exactly what vegans can and can\\'t eat.So to sum up:Small bagsDeliciously baconyQuite reasonably priced I think.Don\\'t go to clubs in the 1990\\'s.',\n",

Good thing the date is not until the end of Dec which is fine because I don't think it will last that long anyway, lol. Surprisingly, the freshness was kept really well and it taste really better than the one we bought in a shop.

Plenty of time to enjoy them.From the second I opened a bag, I instantly was transported back to the early 80s, and my Aunt's pub - I ate loads of these back then. That smell, a bit like a local chip-shop smell, with a hint of lemon.But it's that taste, there is nothing like it out there. A lovely, salty, sharp taste, these are the real deal. Never has a crispy snack come close to these, and I am so happy to still be able to buy them. I have already consumed 2 bags in 10 minutes, they are that good. Just need some beer, and that will make my night.So, if you fondly remember them, and haven't had a packet in years then get a order in, you won't regret it.\",\n",

Scampi Fries are his favourite pub snack and while the pubs have been shut he can't have them. They have a great tangy flavour and pair nicely with a cold pint of larger/ beer... or craft ale if your a 20 something millennial with a finely pruned tash.They arrived quickly and came on a big bit of cardboard so he can hag them up in the kitchen just like in the pub. Good value for money.\",\n",

There's nothing more to add apart from they're exactly how I remember them, and no other bacon flavour snack comes close to these, not even Frazzles. So delicious and so addictive - the scampi fries are nice too! :)The 24 packs should last quite a while unless you're having more than one pack at a time, in which case you've only got yourself to blame. Eat in moderation if you can, and they'll last a lot longer. :) TIP: Having them on a card is great, but just make sure you keep them out of sight to avoid temptation!\",\n",

At some point i stopped going to pubs very often but about 4 years ago I was in a pub and fancied some scampi fries only to be told that they were in short supply. During Lockdown they emerged again online but the prices were often a bit steep. i am very glad to see that they appear to be both plentiful and affordable once more. They say that your perception of taste changes with time but these taste just as good today as they did in 1992.',\n",

Had to put them away as daughter and I are dechoxing for March but decided to up the anti and not just stop with chocolate, included biscuits, cakes, sweets and crisps.Pity my OH didn't join us as these arrived along with the bacon ones, by the time dechox ends on 31st March there won't be any left fir me to enjoy as he will have even the entire card of both to himself during March alone.Def too moreish if one person can consume that many in a short space of time\",\n",
